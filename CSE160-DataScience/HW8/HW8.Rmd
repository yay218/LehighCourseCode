Install and load kknn library
```{r}
#install.packages("kknn")
library(kknn)
```

Load the train and test data
```{r}
train<-read.csv("http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/course/2017/datascience/TitanicTrain.csv", sep = ",")
test<-read.csv("http://www.cse.lehigh.edu/~brian/course/2017/datascience/TitanicTest.csv", sep = ",")
```

Clean the data
Transform the age attribute to an integer value in both data sets since the original data provided age with some decimal points. I do this using round()) function in R on the age columns of both training set and test set to coerce a numeric value into an integer.
For the fare columns, the functions of round() is utilized in order to format the fare values into numbers with 2 decimal places to accurately represent the format of a price. 
```{r}
train$age <- round(train$age, digits = 0)
train$fare <- round(train$fare, digits = 2)
test$age <- round(test$age, digits = 0)
test$fare <- round(test$fare, digits = 2)
```

The glm model
Factor the survived, since str(train) shows that survived is integer, so factor it, and build the model.
Use the model on the test set and get predictions, make a confusion matrix, and calculate (and output) precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy
```{r}
glm_model <- glm(formula = as.factor(survived) ~ pclass + fare + sex + age + embarked, data=train, family=binomial)
glm_prediction <- predict(glm_model, test, type = 'response')

glm_table <- table(glm_prediction > 0.5, test$survived)
glm_table


glm_TP <- glm_table[1,1]
glm_FP <- glm_table[1,2]
glm_FN <- glm_table[2,1]
glm_TN <- glm_table[2,2]

glm_precision <- glm_TP / (glm_TP + glm_FP)
glm_recall <- glm_TP / (glm_TP + glm_FN)
glm_fmeasure <- 2*(glm_precision * glm_recall) / (glm_precision + glm_recall)
glm_accuracy <- sum(diag(glm_table)) / sum(glm_table)

sprintf("The precision for glm model is: %s", glm_precision)
sprintf("The recall for glm model is: %s", glm_recall)
sprintf("The f measure for glm model is: %s", glm_fmeasure)
sprintf("The accuracy for glm model is: %s", glm_accuracy)

```

The knn model
Use the model on the test set and get predictions, make a confusion matrix, and calculate (and output) precision, recall, f-measure and accuracy
```{r}
kknn_model <- kknn(survived ~ pclass + sex + age + fare + embarked, train = train, test = test, distance = 1)
fit <- fitted(kknn_model)

kknn_table <- table(fit > 0.5, test$survived)
kknn_table

kknn_TP <- kknn_table[1,1]
kknn_FP <- kknn_table[1,2]
kknn_FN <- kknn_table[2,1]
kknn_TN <- kknn_table[2,2]

kknn_precision <- kknn_TP / (kknn_TP + kknn_FP)
kknn_recall <- kknn_TP / (kknn_TP + kknn_FN)
kknn_fmeasure <- 2 * (kknn_precision * kknn_recall) / (kknn_precision + kknn_recall)
kknn_accuracy <- sum(diag(kknn_table)) / sum(kknn_table)

sprintf("The precision for knn model is: %s", kknn_precision)
sprintf("The recall for knn model is: %s", kknn_recall)
sprintf("The f measure for knn model is: %s", kknn_fmeasure)
sprintf("The accuracy for knn model is: %s", kknn_accuracy)
